# chrome-stop-closing

When you click "Close" (the actual red button) in Google Chrome for macOS, it closes all the tabs without warning. There is no built in way to prevent this. 

A workaround that works: open a page which warns you upon closing. This works by default if you start typing in a text field, for example. Or you can force this behaviour with JavaScirpt.

This [page](https://rakh.im/chrome-stop-closing/) is exacly that. Open [it](https://rakh.im/chrome-stop-closing/), pin the tab and forget about accidentally closing a whole bunch of tabs.

Oh, and it shows a random cat picture, which makes it even better.

P.S. You can restore tabs one by one with Cmd+Shift+T, but that's still pain in the ass.
